# How to Find a Great Job

Job hunting can be tough. Most of the time *it is* tough.

My method to make it a little a bit easier, is by scraping the internet through and through, 
constructing a huge data base of relevant companies, and making personal connection to assure my CV go in the right place.

By working in this systematic and high-scale method, I am able to increase my chances of finding a *great* job,
and also make the process less painful as I am maintaining a constant stream of opportunities.

I wrote a [blog post](https://bit.ly/GreatJobBlog) describing this method, and also gave a talk about it
at [Baot](http://extend-tech.com/baot)'s job search program.
