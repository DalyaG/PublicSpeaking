# Offline Solution to Online Problems 

We live in an online world. 
As consumers we expect our demands to be answered on the spot, 
and as creators we design our products to answer consumers' immediate requests. 
In Via (https://ridewithvia.com/), for example, the minute you ask for a ride, 
you will be assigned a van - a live imitation of a greedy algorithm. 

But what if the algorithm had the input that in a minute from now 
I will also ask for a ride with similar origin and destination? 
then it will be able to optimize the assignment - 
it will keep you waiting for just a minute, so that we can ride together, 
even more cheaply and economically than ever!

This talk revolves a project I lead in Via, which addresses this issue, 
where the goal is to imagine we knew all requests in advance, 
and make the best assignment to vans based on this "omniscience".

I gave a technical version of this talk at a PyDataTLV MeetUp
([event](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/events/245676534/),
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1FMe4yK7zY)), 
and also a shorter high-level version at the 
Tel Aviv Women in Data Science Conference 2018
([event](http://intuit.eventiko.co.il/),
[video - my talk starts at 2:04](https://goo.gl/iW2pJE)).
