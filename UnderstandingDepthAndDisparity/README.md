# Understanding Depth and Disparity

In this session we will learn how elementary Geometry is being used in modern Computer vision algorithms!

Calculating the distance between a set of cameras and an object in front of them 
is an important task for many applications, 
such as (semi-)autonomous driving, robotic house cleaning, and, 
you know, also as a seeing human who just wants to avoid bumping into things...

This task is called calculating depth in stereo vision, and the goal of this talk is to explain how this is done.

I recorded this talk as part of the [Baot](https://extend-tech.com/baot)
