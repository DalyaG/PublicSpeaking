# "Everyone can Data!" - A Practical Data Science Intro

Ever wondered what this "data science" talk is all about? 
Well, wonder no more!

In this intro talk, 
we will overview some very basic concepts in data science, 
and learn how we can all implement them in super cool projects of our own.
 
Let's visit helpful online resources, 
throw project ideas in the air, 
and pave the path for inspiration and perspiration :)
