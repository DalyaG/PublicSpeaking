# Technical Communication

We all have ideas we want to share with the world, be it our colleagues in a brainstorming session,
the readers of our technical blog, and sometimes even someone we just met at a conference lunch table.

The skills we use in these occasions, happen to be all similar skills,
and improving our technical communications in one setting can help us improve in all other settings as well.
Furthermore, when we communicate our technical ideas, be it our problems or our solutions,
we reflect on our work and become more professional in our everyday job.

Great! I want in! But how?

Here's the tl;dr - you need to ask yourself 4 questions:

1. **Why am I here?** (make it personal, 
   and share your personal motive with the audience)

2. **Why are YOU here?** (find out the technical background of your audience, 
   and take the setting into account)

3. **Why are WE here?** (define your focus/goal, 
   and have clear takeaways you expect the audience to learn/understand)
   
4. **What structure best serves the answers to the questions above?**

When you have these questions answered, plan ahead, be goal oriented,
and keep everything in a scope that fits the occasion.
Having said that, I think this is enough for a Github README, so I'm gonna stop here.


P.S.

I gave this talk at [Baot's Clean Code MeetUp #4](http://extend-tech.com/baot), 
and at [Baot's Tech Blogging Workshop](https://www.facebook.com/baot.tech/posts/822826681532844).

I also wrote a [blog post](https://codeburst.io/technical-communications-c457b5c7da) 
summarizing the essentials of composing a winning tech talk/blog.
