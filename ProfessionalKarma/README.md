# Personal Branding?  Professional Karma!

What comes to your mind when you hear the concept "Personal Branding"?  
Most likely, there is at least a tiny piece of you that feels uncomfortable. Either this feels phony or opportunist, or it reminds you of someone who does it badly.  
I get it. I fell the same way.  
Yet I love public speaking, technical blogging, and participating in all kinds and levels of professional communities - so how does it add up?  
Professional Karma is my answer.

When we contribute our knowledge to our professional pool, the act of giving is inherently intertwined with getting something in return.  
That something could be anywhere between receiving higher appreciation from colleagues and peers, to finding assistance in a complicated task, and even landing a dream job.  
Indeed, our Personal Brand is a by-product of our active participation in professional communities.

If you want to learn how to jumpstart the feedback loop of Professional Karma, join me for this talk.  
We will explore the many benefits of extending our professional selves into the public arena, how can we do it best, and what can we do today to launch this process.
