# Help your colleagues help themselves - a Sphinx tutorial

Have you ever found yourself developing a tool only to find it already exists somewhere else in the code?
Have you ever wondered what does AlexsCoolFunction do?
Did you ever put a funny comment in your code and was upset that noone will read it?

Then maybe itâ€™s time to have a better documentation system!

In this tutorial, we will sail through the onboarding stage of [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) - an automated documentation package, and learn how we can all collaborate better.

This tutorial is backed by a [repository](https://github.com/DalyaG/Sphinx185) that holds an example project - you can browse the [output documentation](https://dalyag.github.io/Sphinx185/index.html) and download the [example template](https://github.com/DalyaG/Sphinx185/tree/master/documentation_template_for_your_next_project) so you can easily start documenting your next project!

I gave this talk at [PyCon Israel 2018](https://il.pycon.org/2018/schedule/presentation/28/),
