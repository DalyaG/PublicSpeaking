# PyGraphicsGui

Research Independence. For some of us, it's a necessity since we work for a small startup, for example. 
For some, it's the mere joy of quickly closing a feedback loop. And for some, like me, it's both.

As a computer vision algorithms engineer, I am frequently tackled with bottlenecks in my pipeline that can be 
solved by removing some friction for the human-in-the-loop. 
This can range from annotation tasks to verification and interactive visualizations.

The goal of this talk is to present a CookieCutter for Pythonic GUIs, 
that can shorten the cycle of tacking such bottlenecks: [PyGraphicsGui](github.com/DalyaG/PyGraphicsGui)
On top of discussing the motivation for this project, and how it can be useful to you, 
we will cover the basics of computer graphics - so that you too could easily develop cool tools for your humans in your loops.
