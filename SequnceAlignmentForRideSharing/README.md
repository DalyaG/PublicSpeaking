# Sequence Alignment for Ride Sharing

As researchers and developers, we constantly face new problems, and challenge existing solutions to old problems.
On beautiful circumstances, solved problems from one domain shed light on new problems from totally different domains.

This happened to me while I was researching a Ride Sharing problem, and got inspiration from a DNA Sequence Alignment algorithm.

The Ride Sharing problem we will discuss is a constrained optimization problem of finding efficient ways of grouping multiple riders on a single taxi.
We will also overview the biological context that was the inspiration, and take a close look at the hybrid algorithm that provided a significantly more efficient solution.

This is a light-weight-suitable-for-after-work-hours overview of the steps of the algorithm; it includes a selection of non-mandatory mathematical formulas, for people like me who enjoy the extra spice of supporting equations.

I gave this talk at the Algorithms Israel MeetUp
