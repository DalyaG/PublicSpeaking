# PublicSpeaking
Slides and links to videos of some of my public talks.
 
Enjoy, and spread the knowledge :)

#### A little bit about me:

A mathematician at heart, 
an algorithmatician in practice. 
After receiving my MSc. in math from TAU 
I ventured into data science and algorithms domains, 
glad to discover that the real world is at least as exciting as the abstract. 
Currently algorithms researcher at Via - On Demand Transit, 
applying both my theoretical and practical passions.

Founder of 
[Algorithms Israel](https://www.meetup.com/Algorithms-Israel/) 
and co-organizer of 
[PyData Tel Aviv](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/)
MeetUps.

## Offline Solution to Online Problems 

We live in an online world. 
As consumers we expect our demands to be answered on the spot, 
and as creators we design our products to answer consumers' immediate requests. 
In Via (https://ridewithvia.com/), for example, the minute you ask for a ride, 
you will be assigned a van - a live imitation of a greedy algorithm. 

But what if the algorithm had the input that in a minute from now 
I will also ask for a ride with similar origin and destination? 
then it will be able to optimize the assignment - 
it will keep you waiting for just a minute, so that we can ride together, 
even more cheaply and economically than ever!

This talk revolves a project I lead in Via, which addresses this issue, 
where the goal is to imagine we knew all requests in advance, 
and make the best assignment to vans based on this "omniscience".

I gave a technical version of this talk at a PyDataTLV MeetUp
([event](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/events/245676534/),
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1FMe4yK7zY)), 
and also a shorter high-level version at the 
Tel Aviv Women in Data Science Conference 2018
([event](http://intuit.eventiko.co.il/),
[video - my talk starts at 2:04](https://goo.gl/iW2pJE)).

## TeMS - 17 Lines of Code That Got Me My Dream Job

Solving a textual math problem is a complicated task, 
requiring both mathematical understanding and language proficiency. 

Well, what if we could train a neural network to do both? 

And what if we could use existing tools to do it in just a few lines of code?

This talk is about a a neural network I constructed, 
that reads a textual math problem 
and outputs the underlying equation.
 
I gave a short version of this talk at a PyDataTLV MeetUp
([event](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/events/239823945/),
[video - my talk starts at 19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j8vfW94o6Y)).

I also gave a longer (Hebrew) version of this talk at the Women in Tech Forum
([event](https://www.meetup.com/at-wix/events/246859972/),
[video](https://youtu.be/W9U2Qb1F5h8)), 
where I start with an introduction to neural networks,
and end with a "meta" description of this project, how it came about,
and how working on it helped my advance my career.

## "Everyone can Data!" - A Practical Data Science Intro

Ever wondered what this "data science" talk is all about? 
Well, wonder no more!

In this intro talk, 
we will overview some very basic concepts in data science, 
and learn how we can all implement them in super cool projects of our own.
 
Let's visit helpful online resources, 
throw project ideas in the air, 
come up with a framework for team collaboration, 
and pave the path for inspiration and perspiration :)

I gave this talk at the preparation event to 
[HackExtend](http://www.hackextend.com/)
[(video - Hebrew)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxn1q1W9Hk8&index=6&list=PLY-poECvi6h7VQWt5Nd5O42py_07UKifI), 
a super cool hackathon that welcomes everyone!

## Sequence Alignment for Ride Sharing

As researchers and developers, we constantly face new problems, and challenge existing solutions to old problems.
On beautiful circumstances, solved problems from one domain shed light on new problems from totally different domains.

This happened to me while I was researching a Ride Sharing problem, and got inspiration from a DNA Sequence Alignment algorithm.

The Ride Sharing problem we will discuss is a constrained optimization problem of finding efficient ways of grouping multiple riders on a single taxi.
We will also overview the biological context that was the inspiration, and take a close look at the hybrid algorithm that provided a significantly more efficient solution.

This is a light-weight-suitable-for-after-work-hours overview of the steps of the algorithm; it includes a selection of non-mandatory mathematical formulas, for people like me who enjoy the extra spice of supporting equations.

I gave this talk at the Algorithms Israel MeetUp
[Algorithms Israel MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Algorithms-Israel/events/251504953/),[video - Hebrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5so2Gbzd3xI).

## Help your colleagues help themselves - a Sphinx tutorial

Have you ever found yourself developing a tool only to find it already exists somewhere else in the code?
Have you ever wondered what does AlexsCoolFunction do?
Did you ever put a funny comment in your code and was upset that noone will read it?

Then maybe itâ€™s time to have a better documentation system!

In this tutorial, we will sail through the onboarding stage of [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) - an automated documentation package, and learn how we can all collaborate better.

This tutorial is backed by a [repository](https://github.com/DalyaG/Sphinx185) that holds an example project - you can browse the [output documentation](https://dalyag.github.io/Sphinx185/index.html) and download the [example template](https://github.com/DalyaG/Sphinx185/tree/master/documentation_template_for_your_next_project) so you can easily start documenting your next project!

I gave this talk at [PyCon Israel 2018](https://il.pycon.org/2018/schedule/presentation/28/), you can watch the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OAAL78PES8).
