# TeMS - 17 Lines of Code That Got Me My Dream Job

Solving a textual math problem is a complicated task, 
requiring both mathematical understanding and language proficiency. 

Well, what if we could train a neural network to do both? 

And what if we could use existing tools to do it in just a few lines of code?

This talk is about a a neural network I constructed, 
that reads a textual math problem 
and outputs the underlying equation.
 
I gave a short version of this talk at a PyDataTLV MeetUp
([event](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/events/239823945/),
[video - my talk starts at 19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j8vfW94o6Y)).

I also gave a longer (Hebrew) version of this talk at the Women in Tech Forum
([event](https://www.meetup.com/at-wix/events/246859972/),
[video](https://youtu.be/W9U2Qb1F5h8)), 
where I start with an introduction to neural networks,
and end with a "meta" description of this project, how it came about,
and how working on it helped me advance my career.
