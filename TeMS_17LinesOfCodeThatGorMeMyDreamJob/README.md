# TeMS - 17 Lines of Code That Got Me My Dream Job

Solving a textual math problem is a complicated task, 
requiring both mathematical understanding and language proficiency. 

Well, what if we could train a neural network to do both? 

And what if we could use existing tools to do it in just a few lines of code?

This talk is about a a neural network I constructed, 
that reads a textual math problem 
and outputs the underlying equation.
 
I gave a short version of this talk at a 
[PyDataTLV MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/events/239823945/),
[(video - my talk starts at 19:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j8vfW94o6Y).

I also gave a longer version of this talk at
[Wix Tech Talks Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/at-wix/events/246859972/),
[(video - Hebrew)](https://youtu.be/W9U2Qb1F5h8),  
where I start with an introduction to neural networks,
and end with a "meta" description of this project, how it came about,
and how working on it helped me advance my career.

You can also read about the technical details of the project in this 
[blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/dear-math-i-am-not-your-therapist-solve-your-own-problems-da835102dacb).
